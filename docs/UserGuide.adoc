== Introduction
Seller Manager Lite (SML) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their sales*. More importantly, SML is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SML can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

`v1.4` only allows statistics on orders marked as `Completed` and calculates the three type of
statistics as shown below.

Accepts two types of input: Without date input and with date input +

Generates the statistics with no date input. +
Used for calculating `total profit` , `total Revenue` and `total Cost`. +
Format: `generate-s s/stat` +
Type for `stat` includes: `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` +
The argument must match this three words perfectly.

Shown below:


image::StatsExampleDefault.png[width="600"]


Generates the statistics with date input in chart format (in pop-up modal dialog). +
Format: `generate-s s/stat d1/YYYY.MM.DD d2/YYYY.MM.DD` +
Example: `generate-s s/revenue d1/2019.10.16 d2/2019.11.21` +
Format for date is in YYYY.MM.DD e.g `2019.05.12`

Shown below:

image::StatsExampleGraph.png[width="600"]

Limitations:

* Range of dates affecting chart display:
** The chart is able to accept a large range of dates, but take note that above a
certain threshold the gap between the months will change, depending on how large of a range you are calculating.
This behaviour is intentional and not a bug.

*Date range starts from 1970 onwards
** Date of year input starts from 1970 onwards. This is enough to fit our use case. Anything lower will be rejected.

* Load time:
** Do not be alarmed if the window does not pop up immediately upon click. For larger data sets
we estimate at least a few seconds before the window will be loaded.

Coming in `V2.0`:

* Average Statistics
** More advanced commands like `average profit` etc

* Different Charts
** Instead of just being able to display via a line chart, users will be able to select the type of chart

* Export Chart to PDF
** User will be able to export their charts to pdf with a click of a button.
